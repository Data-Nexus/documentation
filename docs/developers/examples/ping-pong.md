# Ping Pong

`Ping` is a contract on some domain and `Pong` is a contract on some other domain. The user sends a ping and a pong will be sent back!

This example demonstrates how to use nested `xcall`s and a single direction emulating "callback" behavior.


## Ping Contract

The `Ping` contract contains an external `sendPing` function that the user will call to initiate the flow. It *also* implements `IXReceiver` because it will act as the "target" of an `xcall` from `Pong`. The `xReceive` function here is essentially a callback function - we can verify that something happened in `Pong`'s domain and handle any results passed back.

Note that the user will first have to approve a spending allowance of the token to the `Ping` contract.

## Pong Contract

`Pong` will send a nested `xcall` back to `Ping`, including some information that can be acted on.
